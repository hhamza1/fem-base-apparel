## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - The input field is empty
    - The email address is not formatted correctly

ONLY HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS 

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
